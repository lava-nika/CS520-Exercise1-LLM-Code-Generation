Problem:
def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string.
    Algorithm idea is simple:
    - Find the longest postfix of supplied string that is a palindrome.
    - Append to the end of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.
    >>> make_palindrome('')
    ''
    >>> make_palindrome('cat')
    'catac'
    >>> make_palindrome('cata')
    'catac'
    """

Process:
1. First, implement a solution
2. Then, act as a code reviewer and check for:
   - Off-by-one errors
   - Edge cases (empty input, single element, etc.)
   - Type handling issues
   - Logic errors
3. If you find issues, provide a corrected version

Provide the final, debugged implementation.
