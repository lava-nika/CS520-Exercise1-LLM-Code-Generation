Generate a solution for this problem, then review it for potential bugs:

Problem:
def generate_integers(a, b):
    """
    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a
    and b, in ascending order.

    For example:
    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]
    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]
    generate_integers(10, 14) => []
    """

Process:
1. First, implement a solution
2. Then, act as a code reviewer and check for:
   - Off-by-one errors
   - Edge cases (empty input, single element, etc.)
   - Type handling issues
   - Logic errors
3. If you find issues, provide a corrected version

Provide the final, debugged implementation.
