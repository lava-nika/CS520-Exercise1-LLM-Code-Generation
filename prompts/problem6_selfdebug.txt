Generate a solution for this problem, then review it for potential bugs:

Problem:
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    """ brackets is a string of "(" and ")".
    return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    >>> correct_bracketing("(")
    False
    >>> correct_bracketing("()")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("(()())")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing(")(()")
    False
    """

Process:
1. First, implement a solution
2. Then, act as a code reviewer and check for:
   - Off-by-one errors
   - Edge cases (empty input, single element, etc.)
   - Type handling issues
   - Logic errors
3. If you find issues, provide a corrected version

Provide the final, debugged implementation.
