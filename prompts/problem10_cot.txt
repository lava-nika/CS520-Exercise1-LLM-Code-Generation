Problem:
def generate_integers(a, b):
    """
    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a
    and b, in ascending order.

    For example:
    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]
    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]
    generate_integers(10, 14) => []
    """

Please:
1. Explain the problem in your own words
2. Describe your approach and algorithm
3. Consider edge cases
4. Then implement the solution

Provide the final code implementation.
