Generate a solution for this problem, then review it for potential bugs:

Problem:
def count_nums(arr):
    """
    Write a function count_nums which takes an array of integers and returns
    the number of elements which has a sum of digits > 0.
    If a number is negative, then its first signed digit will be negative:
    e.g. -123 has signed digits -1, 2, 3.
    >>> count_nums([]) == 0
    >>> count_nums([-1, 11, -11]) == 1
    >>> count_nums([1, 1, 2]) == 3
    """

Process:
1. First, implement a solution
2. Then, act as a code reviewer and check for:
   - Off-by-one errors
   - Edge cases (empty input, single element, etc.)
   - Type handling issues
   - Logic errors
3. If you find issues, provide a corrected version

Provide the final, debugged implementation.
