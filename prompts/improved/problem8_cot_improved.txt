IMPROVED Chain-of-Thought Prompt for problem8

import math


def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 + .... xs[n] * x^n

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """ xs are coefficients of a polynomial.
    find_zero find x such that poly(x) = 0.
    find_zero returns only only zero point, even if there are many.
    Moreover, find_zero only takes list xs having even number of coefficients
    and largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees
    a solution.
    >>> round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2) # f(x) = 1 + 2x

    >>> round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2) # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Your function MUST be named exactly: find_zero
2. Do not create alternative function names or variants
3. The function signature must match the prompt exactly

DEBUGGING HINTS:
- For root-finding problems: Use bisection method for guaranteed convergence
- Test your solution with edge cases
- Ensure numerical precision meets requirements (typically 1e-4 or better)

Please implement this step by step:
1. Understand the problem requirements
2. Plan your approach (for numerical problems, prefer stable algorithms like bisection)
3. Implement the solution with the EXACT function name: find_zero
4. Test with the provided examples
