Solve this programming problem step by step. First, explain your reasoning and approach, then write the code.

Problem:
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Input to this function is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. Your goal is to
    separate those group into separate strings and return the list of those.
    Separate groups are balanced (each open brace is properly closed) and not nested within each other
    Ignore any spaces in the input string.
    >>> separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))')
    ['()', '(())', '(()())']
    """

Please:
1. Explain the problem in your own words
2. Describe your approach and algorithm
3. Consider edge cases
4. Then implement the solution

Provide the final code implementation.
